# DiyDeck
 Stream Deck alternative for DIY-spirited people! This has 5 Analog Pots and 7 buttons that you can configure freely to whatever. 
 Case is 3d-printed, and fits Arduino Pro Micro clones nicely. Case files are in the STL-folder, i will update and put firmware to repository aswell when i'm 100% happy with it.

 ## Bill Of Materials
 - The 3d-printed case, obviously
 - 5 pcs EC11 Rotary encoders 
 - 5 pcs Potentiometer/encoder knobs.
 - 7 MX-switches. Just your regular mechanical keyboard switches.
 - 7 MX-keycaps. I just used whatever i had in my closet. You can buy fancy ones or just steal from your old keyboard or whatever.
 - A dev board. The case is actually designed for Arduino Pro Micro in terms of size, but i ended up using RP2040-zeros, because i love working with them.
 - (Optional) WS2812B light strip if you want some RGB action for your keys.
 - 4 Computer case screws
 - Wiring (i just used some old 24awg wire i had laying around)
 - Soldering iron, tin and flux
 - 14mm case feet (kinda optional but it'll glide around the desk without any feet. Can be smaller too if the size is hard to find)
