# DiyDeck
 Stream Deck alternative for DIY-spirited people! This has 5 Analog Pots and 7 buttons that you can configure freely to whatever. 
 Case is 3d-printed, and fits Arduino Pro Micro clones nicely. Grab the files from the STL-folder, install all the junk to the case, flash the firmware from arduino-folder and you're almost set!

 ## Bill Of Materials
 - The 3d-printed case, obviously
 - 5 pcs B10K potentiometers, i just grabbed the cheapest ones from aliexpress, and then ordered 5 more because one of them was dead on arrival. Live and learn.
 - 5 pcs Potentiometer knobs.
 - 7 MX-switches. Just your regular mechanical keyboard switches.
 - 7 MX-keycaps. I just used whatever i had in my closet. You can buy fancy ones or just steal from your old keyboard or whatever.
 - Arduino Pro Micro (clone). Clones because they never made an usb-c one.
 - WS2812B light strip (this is optional, but i think it adds lot usability)
 - 4 Computer case screws
 - Wiring (i just used some old 24awg wire i had laying around)
 - Soldering iron, tin and flux
 - 14mm case feet (kinda optional but it'll glide around the desk without any feet. Can be smaller too if the size is hard to find)
